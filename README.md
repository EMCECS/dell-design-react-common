}

export type MainPageState = Readonly<typeof initialState>;

export default class MainPage extends Component<MainPageProps> {
    readonly state: MainPageState = initialState;

    render() {
        return(
            <MainContainer>

## SASS Style conventions
1. SCSS File Structure
styles
 -> Common
 -> Components
 index.scss
Common utility styles such as Variables, Mixins, Functions, Fonts, Layout (padding, margin) etc. under the Common folder and reusable component styles are under Components like Buttons, Inputs etc.

2. Use more generic to specific, semantically-named variables with kebab-case for example:
Avoid- $blue-border, $light-blue-border has no pattern

Prefer - $border-blue, $border-light-blue 
This pattern helps in recollection and hinting by editor.
In this pattern you can start generically and get more specific as the text editor auto-suggests variable names.
3. Declare/ indent the related CSS properties together so it helps to identify repeated blocks for reuse.
For example - all margin related stlyes (top, left, right etc) should be declared together, font-size, font-weight etc 

4. If block of style is getting repeated use mixins
5. If something needs to be calculated and returned depending on variables then use function
6. If some style is repeated declare and use as variable
7. The color codes are named as per Dell Design Standard, refer this page if any code is missing and needs to be added. https://web.ddsproduct.com/31b3fd8b1/p/60290f-colors
8. Avoid naming variables with actual values they hold, instead name them by the function they do, for example:
Avoid- $padding-top-5: 5px;
As value of the this would always remain 5px
Prefer- $checkbox-padding-top: 5px;
